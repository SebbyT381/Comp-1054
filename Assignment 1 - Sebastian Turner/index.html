    <p>
    Meet me <span class="wind">glassy-eyed, blind, and divine</span>
    Hold down the fort on the coastline
    The castle is a <span class="slime">pimple</span> on the face of our orb
    A humble spot for clues to drop if you eavesdrop

    I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
    Water's rising up, <span class="slime">thick and green</span>, crumbling castle
    Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
    <span class="bold">Are we safe in our citadel?</span>

    <span class="bold">Look upon our condition</span>, crumbling castle
    <span class="bold">You would not believe where I'm from</span>, crumbling castle

    We wait for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
    Dug all the holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
    We have even said our <span class="bold">last rites</span>, crumbling castle
    <span class="bold">Are we safe in our holding cell?</span>

    <span class="bold">Look upon our condition</span>, crumbling castle
    <span class="bold">We head to our extinction</span>, crumbling castle

    The sounds of the constant <span class="lightning">lightning</span>
    Would be enough to block out
    The thought of the <span class="bold">end of the world</span>
    If it were not for our tinnitus from the bomb

    <span class="wind">In the wind I sway, back and forth</span>
    I'm brittle as an aged human being
    Where my walls are safe from <span class="wind">wild weather</span>
    <span class="slime">The filth forms into great nastiness</span>
    <span class="slow">Polygondwanaland</span>

    <span class="bold">I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>
    <span class="bold">I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>

    I don't want to fall into <span class="wind">dust</span>
    I don't want nothing but to live on
    <span class="bold">The ache inside my keep spurs me on</span>
    I don't want to be <span class="wind">invisible</span>
    <span class="slow">Polygondwanaland</span>

    <span class="bold">I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>
    <span class="bold">I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>

    On this very day, in <span class="wind">one thousand</span> years
    The earth will be relative to the sun and the moon
    And a new world will be created
    I know because it is <span class="wind">written</span> here

    I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
    Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
    Water's rising up, <span class="slime">thick and green</span>, crumbling castle
    <span class="bold">Are we safe in our citadel?</span>

    <span class="bold">Look upon our condition</span>, crumbling castle
    <span class="bold">You would not believe where I'm from</span>, crumbling castle

    <span class="bold">I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>
    <span class="bold">Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>
    <span class="bold">Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>
    <span class="bold">Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle</span>
